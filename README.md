## About

I've uploaded the culmination of 2 research projects from my courses so far at UC Berkeley, and plan to upload more following my graduation in May 2025.

Under `ml-research` you will find the research my project partners and I conducted for our machine learning course. In this project, we created and tested a variety of ML models on an early asthma diagnosis dataset.

Under `nlp-research` you will find the research my project partners and I conducted for our natural language processing course. In this project, we found an online dataset of different types of jokes, cleaned the data of duplicates, annotated the dataset with the types of humor, then built and ran a BERT model on the data to classify the type of humor in a given joke.
